# How to build a design brief for a project

I need help creating a design brief for {{type of project}}.

Please help me define:

1. Design Style & Aesthetic
   - What visual style best suits this project?
   - What mood/feeling should the design evoke?
   - Any specific design movements or styles to reference?

2. Target Audience
   - Who will use this?
   - What are their preferences and expectations?
   - What devices will they primarily use?

3. Key Features & Priorities
   - What are the core features to highlight?
   - What's the primary user action?
   - What should stand out most?

Based on my answers, create a comprehensive design brief that I can use with AI coding assistants.
